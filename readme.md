This code trains a custom CNN on the MNIST dataset (acc = 99%) and extracts the model's feature extractor block. A subset of the dataset is selected and their feature vectors are calculated using the trained feature extractor. The Pearson correlation (Rho) for each pair of vectors is then calculated. It is assumed that the images belonging to the same class should have higher correlation values. This assumption holds.
